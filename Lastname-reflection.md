## GPS 1.1 Reflections

**_What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?_**
-  Prior to this GPS session, I was struggling with the process of committing, pushing, pulling, and merging, but I really think going through the assignment with my guide helped me talk myself through the process and ask for clarification when needed. I just was a little confused of what the proper protocol and steps were in the process but i now feel way more confident after this session. It is easy to read through a lesson and have it sort of fade in the back of your mind; actually doing the process you are learning about is my quickest way to really absorbing the material.  I also think that the command line lingo is something that likewise comes with exposure and that the more I use it I will be able to navigate it effortlessly.



**_What concepts were clarified during the GPS?_**
-  Creating and cloning a repo
-  Navigating the terminal in Git and how to use command line prompts correctly
-  Tracking changes in Git and how Version Control actually works
-  Master Branch vs. Feature Branch: how to create them, what they are in the context of Git, and how to delete them as well.
-  Pushing and pulling commits to and from GitHub
-  Markdown language
-  Fetching and Merging
-  Merging conflicts: what they are and how they could potentially occur


**_What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?_**
-  I did find myself asking questions especially during the few times I got stuck. My guide Iulia did an excellent job of coaching me and answering my concerns while making me work for it; she would hint at the right path, and then I made those connections to find the answer. In particular I was a little confused on the correct protocol for creating and deleting branches, and not only did she clarify how to do this, but also explained the significance in the context of a real, work setting and further gave me a link to do research on about the topic. I also wasn't very familiar with the markdown language, so she helped answer what it needed to know to complete the challenge. I also asked my guide about 'merge conflicts' because this was the first time I had encountered one and I wanted to know how this would arise in a typical work setting (apparently it happens so it's good to now know how to resolve it!).  She even taught me a couple of nifty keyboard shortcuts to do things in my terminal that much quicker.



**_What still confuses you about git?_**
-  I wouldn't say I'm confused by the actual process of fetching and merging, but I was a little shaky with the correct order of operations. Since I probably came across as weaker in this subject I have since looked up the process further and also realize that practice is the best path to understanding. To my knowledge this was the first time I had encountered anything like a merge conflict; I was unsure at first at what was going on but I now see how it can arise during conlicting merges between different branches when you are working with a bunch of people in Git. 


**_How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?_**
-  Overall I felt surprisingly confident during my first GPS experience. I did not have the traditional experience since I did not technically have a partner; nobody signed up for the session I attended, but my guide Iulia did an excellent job of simulating the experience as though I was the 'driver' and her the 'navigator'. I went into feeling pretty prepared and I think that came across; I asked questions when appropriate but I laregly was able to get through the exercises without having to look much up. I think I did a good job by also talking through the entire process and explaining my actions and the intended they would have once I completed them. It was also nice to chat with her a bit and get perspective on her learning process, her background, and what she is doing now.  It was a pleasant GPS!
